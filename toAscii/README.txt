How it works:
-Converts RGB -> Greyscale
-Using obtained greyscale value, appropriate letter if found and written to a text file

Kinks to work out:
-Implement weighted mean method for better accuracy when Converting to greyscale
-Right now each pixel is converted to greyscale, and each pixel is given a character. This becomes a problem with HD pics
as you would need to zoom out alot to see the picture. Solution would be to take a block of pixels and represent it with a single character. 
(Bigger the block -> more detail lost in ascii picture)
